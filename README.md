# Readme

Mirror of my solution to A4 for CompSci 335 at UoA. This is the version written in JS/CSS/HTML - for the Kotlin version see [here.](https://github.com/Cole-Maguire/335-a4-kotlin)

Note that this assignment was originally completed using a provided, locally hosted server, but as this was not my own work, I've elected not to include it in this repo. There is a public version of the server that was provided to also test against, and all API calls have been changed to use that server but I cannot guarantee that:

* All API calls still work as intended - especially when authentication is required.
* The server will still be working into the future.

All marks have now been released so I feel safe making this public.
